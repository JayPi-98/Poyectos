    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>From a young age I left Mexico in the year 2000 and lived for close to 9 years abroad. I lived in Singapore and Barcelona, 
    during this time I attended international schools, which gave me the opportunity to learn English.
    I returned to Mexico in 2009 and attended a private school in Mexico City. I graduated from high school in 2015.
    I took time to try and find what I wanted to study, I tried getting a pilot license, and got english teaching degree along the way.
    I finally decided to study Computer Science at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Santa Fe. I am currently in my 4th semester.
